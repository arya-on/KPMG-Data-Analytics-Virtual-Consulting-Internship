# KPMG-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Consulting-Internship
I recently had the opportunity to complete the KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Consulting Internship, and it turned out to be quite different from what I expected. Instead of following a traditional course structure, the internship adopted a self-learning approach. I was responsible for my own learning journey, which was both challenging and rewarding.

During the internship, I was given three tasks to tackle: Data Quality Assessment, Data Insights, and Data Presentation. What made it even more interesting was that I had the freedom to choose the technology and platform I wanted to work with to achieve the best results. The instructions provided were clear and helpful.

For the tasks, we were provided with a real business dataset containing customer demographics, addresses, transactions, and a new customer list. Our job was to dive into this data, analyze it, and come up with meaningful insights. Once we submitted our response, we were able to access an ideal response submitted by a KPMG consultant. This was an incredible opportunity to compare our work, identify areas for improvement, and learn from the experts.

One thing I particularly enjoyed about this experience was the chance to learn independently. It felt like I was working on a small professional project where I had to take care of not only the technical aspects but also effective communication. It was a valuable lesson in how important communication is in a corporate environment.

To summarize, the tasks involved delving into business datasets, improving data quality, uncovering customer behavior trends, and presenting our findings through interactive dashboards using tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Excel. Overall, the internship provided a unique and enriching learning experience that allowed me to grow both professionally and personally.

# Module 1: Data Quality Assessment
The task involved examining the quality of the provided datasets, identifying any inconsistencies, and proposing solutions to address them, aiming to avoid future obstacles in the analysis process. Proficiency in Excel, particularly in utilizing tools like filters and other functions, was essential. Furthermore, effective communication skills were required to convey all the relevant information to the client via email.

# Module 2: Data Insights
The objective was to gain valuable insights into prospective customers by examining their past behavior and selecting appropriate data analysis approaches. Several factors were taken into account, including age distribution, recent purchase history over the past three years, job industry category, wealth segment, and number of cars owned, among others. As part of this process, a presentation was created to showcase the data analysis strategies employed and the resulting findings. This presentation served to assist the client in making informed decisions regarding their target customers.

# Module 3: Data Presentation
To display the findings of the previous task such as target customers, top 10 goods, customer demographics, their spending habits in the form of a dashboard using Power BI, Tableau to help in data visualization.
